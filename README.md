# Wine64 under Alpine Docker image

This project brings a barebone, headless installation of **[Wine64](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86_64/wine)** (4.0.3) and **[Winetricks](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/winetricks)** under an Alpine-based Docker image.

If you need a later version of Wine, you may want the [Scott Hardy](https://github.com/scottyhardy)'s [docker-wine
](https://hub.docker.com/r/scottyhardy/docker-wine) Ubuntu-based image (Wine 5.0.1).

I'll build an Alpine package and Docker image for Wine 6 soon.
